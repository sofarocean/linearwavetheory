Contents: Routines to calculate (inverse) linear dispersion relation and some related quantities such as phase and
group velocity. All results are based on the dispersion relation in 2D for linear gravity waves for an observer moving
at velocity Uo, with an ambient current Uc and including suface tension effects:

        w = sqrt( ( ( g * k + tau * k**3 ) * tanh(k*d) ) + K dot Urel

with

    w   :: the encounter frequency,
    g   :: gravitational acceleration
    tau :: kinematice surface tension
    k   :: wavenumber magnitude
    d   :: depth
    K   :: (kx,ky) intrinsic wavenumber vector.
    Urel :: (Ux,Uy) current velocity vector in the observers reference frame. Typically the referene velocity is taken
            in the earth reference frame.

where the wavenumber vector is defined such that in the intrinsic reference frame (moving with the waves) the wavenumber
is directed into the direction of wave propagation. We refer to this as the intrinsic wavenumber.

Functions:
- `intrinsic_dispersion_relation`, calculate angular frequency for a given wavenumber magnitude and depth
- `inverse_intrinsic_dispersion_relation`, calculate wavenumber magnitude for a given angular frequency and depth
- `encounter_dispersion_relation`, calculate angular frequency for a given wavenumber vector, depth, and
        current velocity
- `intrinsic_group_speed`, calculate the group speed given wave number magnitude and depth.
- `intrinsic_phase_speed`, calculate the phase speed given wave number magnitude  and depth.
- `encounter_group_velocity`, calculate the group velocity given wave number vector, depth and current velocity.
- `encounter_phase_velocity`, calculate the phase velocity given wave number vector, depth and current velocity.
- `encounter_phase_speed`, calculate the phase speed given wave number vector, depth and current velocity.
- `encounter_group_speed`, calculate the group speed given wave number vector, depth and current velocity.

Some notes:
---------
- Evanesent waves are not supported.

- I have used encounter frequency/phase velocity etc over the more commonly used absolute frequency/phase velocity.
  a) This allows for inclusion of moving observers with regard to the earth reference frame,
  b) the calling the earths reference frame an absolute reference frame is technically incorrect (though common),
  c) the "absolute"  frequency may become negative for strong counter currents when using intrinsic wavenumbers,
  which is confusing.

- The implementation uses numba to speed up calculations. This allows for straightforward use of looping which is often
  more consise as an implementation while retaining a python-like implementation. The downsides are (among others) that:
  a) the first call to a function will be slow.
  b) error messages are not always very informative due to LLVM compilation.
  c) not all (numpy) functions are available in numba, leading to ugly workarounds. (e.g. np.atleast_1d as used here)

    """
    The group SPEED of a wave moving through an ambient current field with velocity ambient_current_velocity
    (defauly 0) as observed by an observer moving with velocity observer_velocity (default 0) relative to the
    earth reference frame.

    We calculate the result as a function of the intrinsic wavenumber, with magnitude and direction such that the
    wavenumber points in the direction of wave propagation in the intrinsic frame of reference. Depending on the
    magnitude of the ambient current and the wavenumber, this wavenumber may differ in sign -
    though magnitude is preserved for all observers.

    Input
    -----
    :param intrinsic_wavenumber: Wavenumber (rad/m) in the intrinsic frame of reference of the wave specified as a 1D
    numpy array (kx,ky), or as a 2D numpy array with shape (N,2) where N is the number of wavenumbers.

    :param depth: Depth (m). May be a scalar or a numpy array. If a numpy array, must have the same number of rows as
    the number of wavenumbers in intrinsic_wavenumber.

    :param ambient_current_velocity: current (m/s) in the earth reference frame specified as a 1D numpy array (u,v),
    which will be broadcast to an array of the same shape as the wavenumber array, or as a 2D numpy array with the same
    shape as the wavenumber array, in which case the j^th row will be used for the j^th wavenumber. Default (0,0).

    :param physics_options: A PhysicsOptions object containing the physical parameters. If None, the default values are
        used.

    :return: A 1D numpy array with shape (N,) where N is the number of wavenumbers.
